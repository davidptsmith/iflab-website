## Approach

Our strategy was to seek out value-adding architectural integration opportunities to enhance the scope of the artwork project. We recognised an opportunity to contribute to a bold civic identity statement for the public face of the Performing Arts wing of the school campus. This façade will become the main public interface with the wider community, as local use of the new facility grows. The screen canopy artwork can function as a beacon or landmark, leading people into the centre.

## Concept Themes

On this occasion there is a fortuitous body of existing creative research to draw upon. Between them, Rick & Daniel have previously created artworks for Yanchep Secondary College, Two Rocks Primary School, Mindarie Senior College, and East Butler Primary School. So they feel a sense of connection with this coastal region, having done prior research. Rick’s own personal affinity with the coastal experience of the Yanchep/Quinns Rock district and surrounds stems from a childhood on the sands and in the water up and down the shoreline between here and Lancelin, his old home town. Conceptually, our ambition for this Alkimos College artwork is to imbue the artwork design with recognisable traces of the invisible yet tangible natural energy forces touching daily life experience in Alkimos. The ever-present coastal winds, repeating weather systems and persistent oceanic currents; the rhythmic circulation of oceanic swells and tides; the drifting sandbars of the shoreline and the rippling wind driven sand patterns.

## Appearance 

The screen artwork embodies wind movements, through variation in the tilt angle of its modular perforated panels. Viewed from afar, that undulation of panels creates an impression of energy in motion, blowing, surging or rippling across the building. Light, reflection and shadows will produce a tonal play across the screen surface, giving it a constantly shifting appearance. A secondary layer of pattern is embedded in the screen design, within the perforations of the screen panels. This idea was inspired by witnessing the layering of sunlight patterns projected through water from the undulating ocean surface onto rippled sand below. Contrasts in the screen surface opacity are created by two perforation sizes. This subtler pattern aspect is revealed on nearer inspection, and is most apparent when viewed through from within.
