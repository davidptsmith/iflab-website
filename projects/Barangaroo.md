## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Pier Pavilion is a singular pavilion that embraces the multi-layered living histories of Barangaroo.  Through its material expression and structural modesty, it provides a welcome respite for visitors and residents.  From the water, it acts as a beacon and distinctive object on the waterâ€™s edge, while from the land, it signals an architecturally rich destination and checkpoint along Wulugul Walk between Walsh Bay and Darling Harbour.

Its materiality pays tribute to the Aboriginal people of coastal Sydney, particularly to Barangaroo and the Eora fisherwomen, who, within their toolkit, wove together carrejun fishing lines from the fibres of local trees. These powerful women, and their children, would fish all day and into the evening, in often treacherous surf, dominating the local harbours, coastlines, coves and bays, as hunters and providers for their clan. 

The Pier Pavilion celebrates these women through a woven canopy. The digitally knitted rope, specifically fabricated with toughened, recycled fibres for this project, maps patterns that emerge from collaborative, local workshops. A translucent, waterproof roofing material sits above, allowing for dappled, uniform natural light beneath the canopy during the day. Lighting at night-time transforms the canopy into a floating, woven lantern, where the shadow and light play of the weave can also be read from above. 

A modest prefabricated timber structure connects to the ground at strategic points demarking permanent seating, providing valuable shade and accommodation throughout the day and evening.  Under the canopy sits a permanent storage pod, containing AV equipment, digital access points, which hosts signage and screens for events.

The Pier Pavilion is designed to be as adaptable as possible, acknowledging the variety of events that Sydney hosts throughout the year, yet retains its own character and distinctiveness.  It is as comfortable hosting a film screening or small concert as it is an intimate talk or art exhibition, and the lighting strategy ensures it is functional day and night.  
Strategically positioned extension of the woven canopy to the south protects visitors from the prevailing winds, and the design of the structure provides opportunities for creative signage and future temporary graphic installations to this southern threshold.  Preservation of views and permeability has been sympathetically considered as a key design driver.  The lack of perimeter obstructions maintains access for pedestrians from all points, whilst the eastern perimeter is flexible specifically to accommodate a variety of temporary event conditions, including containers of various sizes and configurations.

The Pier Pavilion balances the requirements of the brief through sympathetic design considerations, embracing past, current, and futures histories as well as sustainable and performative material practice within a rich narrative that emerges from appreciation and respect for the living cultures on whose country it resides.
