## Concept

Cygna is an sculptural artwork developed in joint patnership with artist Jon Tarry. if/LAB's, Daniel Giuffre and Jon worked closely on the EOI concept submission which was awarded to the joint venture collaboraiton between both artists. Daniel and Jon, worked on the project together through to completion.

Cygna is a modernist interpretation of Perth’s graceful black swan and the winding Swan River has been installed as an iconic feature of the City’s east end. Standing on the corner of Hay and Pier Streets it is a visual draw card. The concept of Cygna (The Swan) aims to develop notions of cultural mapping, rivers and flight paths of birds.

The artist team's interpretation of the artwork is of black swans articulating their necks with agility which, like the river, emerges as sculptural loop suggesting a connection down Pier and Hay Streets to the river.

## Project

The development of the complex form was via computational design simulation and modelling to generate a sweeping, flowing form that was then deconstructed into 'part' for fabrication. The fabrication processed involved using a 5 axis robotic CNC arm to mill out the form into foam, which was then laminated with carbon fibre sheets and coating with a resin. The fabrication process is similar to that of aircraft and boat building processes.
