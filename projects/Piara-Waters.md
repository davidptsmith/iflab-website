## Concept

**Piara ...**
According to Landgate, Piara Waters was named for “Piara”, a local Noongar language word for the Banksia Attenuata, commonly known as the candlestick banksia. Piara is also the place name of a nearby prominent lake/reserve, which protects a patch of remnant swampy woodland. Formerly a part of Forrestdale, the area was re-named Piara Waters in July 2007. 

This is a new and rapidly growing suburb, expected to continue expanding for the next 5 years or so. The 2006 Census recorded 94 local inhabitants. The population is forecast to exceed 8,000 by the 2021 Census date. 

Such dramatic transformation from sparsely occupied bushland farms into small residential lots, has erased most evidence of the previous character of this place before the new suburb’s gazetting. 

Speculating about what gives a place its unique character, and what aspects of character linger through time, we have chosen to celebrate the earlier natural environment of the region. Conceptually, the intention is to imbue the public artworks’ with a visual resonance of the past natural heritage of the locale, as a contribution to the new School’s emerging identity.

A 2020 flora and vegetation review of the location, suggests the district was once populated with a diversity of native plants, including patches of low open woodlands featuring Banksia attenuata, Banksia menziesii, plus Xanthorrhoea preissiii, (along with cauarinas, nuytsias and melaleucas, growing over tall grasses).

The flowering Banksia, as an emblematic motif, is the inspiration and point of departure for our artwork proposal Option 1. The central cylindrical stair tower is irresistible, as a site for creative expression. Our colour palette cues are sourced from those vibrant displays of Banksia Menziesii in bloom. The sculptural manipulation of the tower volume takes its initial cues from the growth patterns ascending the banksia nut, overlaid with pattening reminiscent of water.

**... Waters**
The second part to our concept responds to the second part of the suburb’s name, and acknowledges the ecological history of connection with Forrestdale and Harrisdale wetland areas and surrounding low-lying seasonal floodplains. The entire district sits above a large water aquifer, the Jandakot groundwater mound, an important source of water for metropolitan Perth. This presence of water all around, though not visible, is somehow a tangible part of th way the suburb distinguishes itself.

The implied motion evident in both our proposed artworks are each evocative of the constant fluid surface movements of water bodies in response to atmospheric conditions. Patterns suggesting water are a motif frequently referenced in Rick Vermey’s visual vocabulary.

An optical illusion of undulating kinetic movement is witnessed, simply by passing by the facade screens. There are no moving parts; it is the viewer’s own motion that creates a morphing and changing effect, in concert with shifting light and shadow, over time.

This variability of appearance allows our artwork designs to become experiential, more than just static things, making them memorable, while also nodding to ephemeral, immaterial qualities of experiencing natural surroundings. In this way we seek to honour this site.

## Project

The facade artwork screen wraps two circular stairs as part of the new school. The design for the school was by **With_ Architecture**.

The artwork is made up of twisting aluminium fins, with the colours and patterns being driven by an image which is mapped onto the surface of the stairs.
