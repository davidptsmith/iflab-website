## Project

if/LAB worked in collaboration with Plus Architecture to design a masterplan concept for the high street in Bayswater, WA.

With a new train station scheduled to be completed at the end of the High Street, the team was tasked with exploring density opportunities for King William St in Bayswater. Taking into consideration the listed heritage sites along the high street, and we explored pedestrian movement pathways to and from the station in order to find opportunities for activation.
