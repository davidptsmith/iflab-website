## Concept

The overarching theme for this free standing sculptural artwork is the threatened Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii). The site is situated within close proximity to the Canning River Regional Park. The City of Canning helps to conserve protected fauna species listed as threatened by the Department of Parks and Wildlife. 

The design process involved deconstructing an an image of the female cockatoo and exploring its unique patterns and colours in the feathers - the head has light yellow spots, and the tail has an amazing gradient of yellow to red with unique banding stripes. In addition the the colours and patterns, we explored the idea of motion and flight which can been seen in our conceptual images.

The sculptural form is derrived from the idea of motion and the overlapping nature of the wings' feathers. The colours using are inspired by the colours within the tail.
