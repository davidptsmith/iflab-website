## Concept

A building for an aged-care facility represents change, growth, aging, wisdom and knowledge

The conceptual driver behind the form and 'deconstructed' facade panels is derrived by looking through historical mappings and how they have developed over the last 75 years. The Town of Victoria Park has developed from semi-rural lots and overtime these lots have been sub-divided into smaller sites - gentrification and denisty infil. The landscape of these streets within out metro suburbs are contuniually **changing* as they respond to policy, economics and the communities needs. Over time, these lots are refined into small parcels of land until you have a large corporation aquire 10 lots and amalgamate them into one large lot again for a shopping centre. 

**The artwork facade screen attempts to respond to this paradigm of our build environment and the notion of change within our suburbs - shape, scale, fractured and connected parcles of land.**

The thematic inspiration for the selection of colours used within the facade panels responds to the architect's idea of 'The Tree of Life' and the connection to biophilic design and the benefits of connections with nature to ones's well being. In sticking with these overarching theme, we explored the colors of deciduous tree leaves as they **change* over time and throughout the various seasons. 

<span style="colour:blue">“ We know it’s a rare thing and it makes us feel special, we think it’s either luck, destiny, a sign that something big is going to happen...”</span>.

The lighting within the facade was developed by futher exploring the Autumn theme and the notion of change. The lighting patterns is inspired by the Eta Aquariid meteor shower which occurs every May. A meteor shower appears much like a shooting star in the sky. 
**Wish upon a shooting star**
