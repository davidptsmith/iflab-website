## Concept 

*(words by Artist)*

The Precinct Apartments is a recently completed development designed by Woods Bagot for client, Norup Wilson. 

The artwork content has evolved from visual research inspired by the proximity to the river waters, the natural environmental conditions of shifting breezes, drifting clouds, the vista views and the leafy greenery of open spaces of the locale. Whilst essentially geometric and abstract in derivation, the design is also influenced by its siting adjacent to Canning Highway, which has its own ecosystem of ebbing and flowing traffic swells.

Micro-tidal movements of the vast water bodies of the Canning Bridge area and Melville waters are the initial source of inspiration. Observations of the fluid movements of air currents, such as when  the river breeze drifts through pennants, flags and yacht sails, are another layer of conceptual investigation, with similar visual qualities.

On a more prosaic macro-scale, the Canning Highway itself is another source of inspiration, functioning as it does, like an artery of a living system, with pulsing and surging flows of traffic along its length. Viewed  as an organism, it is yet another example of forces of flow at work, in the immediate surrounding area.

On a sub-surface level, the river has fluctuating measures of marine salinity in different seasons at different depths. Nutrient levels of the Swan/Canning River system, and presence of various microscopic phytoplankton cells are similarly seasonal. These populations also rise and fall in abundance, in succession to one another, in an undulating, overlapping and  repeating pattern over time.  This data can be scientifically graphed as interweaving sine-curves. That graphical representation of natural forces and ecosystems becomes another common motif, influencing the programming of lighting patterns displayed
