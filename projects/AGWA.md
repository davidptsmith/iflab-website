## DESIGN ASSIST

**PROJECT:** AUSTRALIAN GALLERY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA

**ARCHITECT:**  FJMT AND TAG ARCHITECTS

**PROJECT TEAM:**  DANIEL GIUFFRE, DAVID SMITH, PATRICK BENDALL


The AGWA roof canopy was a design concept by Sydney firm FJMT and Perth local practice, TAG architects for the Art Gallery of Western Australia (AGWA).
if/LAB were engaged in an ECI (Early Contractor Involvement) agreement by the architects and BMW to refine and develop the design in preparation for fabrication.

Our scope included: rationalising the complex geometry for fabrication, create a flexible computational design model, produce a comprehensive schedule of quantities/material takeoffs, preparation of shop drawings for fabrication.
