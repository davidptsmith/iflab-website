## Concept

E + ducere: “To lead or draw out.” The etymological Latin roots of “education.” According to some, the fundamental sense of the word is to draw others out of the state of unawareness into a more magnanimous view. Fundametally, it is about change- a transformation from one state to another. A process that Following the folding concept we have designed two alternative proposals that expore the theme of ‘folding’ in two different ways - facets and folds. These forms are conceptualised as continuous origami-like structures that acts as a connective tissue between blocks, transforming from the vertical to a horiozontal elements and providing additional shading, sitting and a space to gather for teaching or lunch.

**The themes for this artwork explore the idea of making thinking visible.**

Exploring concepts connected to STEM fields through a tangible experience of an object undergoing a transformation symbolic of a learning process. It moves through several transformations leading it to change from being a separating barrier to fascilitating sitting to providing shade and, f inally, morphing into the existing canopy. Like a river, it is never the same twice. It integrates the old and the new, between the west end of the new building and D block. It creates a formal, spatial and functional transition creating a connective tissue between various build elements: the balustrade, the entry wall, the floor and the canopy. The form also draws inspiration from mathematical concepts of change over time and utilising avanced modelling and digital fabrication technologies to make complex geometries possible.
