## Concept | History | Theme

**“ A PLACE OF COMING TOGETHER AND CELEBRATION ” - Barry McGuire**

There is a rich Whadjuk Noongar history of occupation here, particularly the residual connection to a corroboree/kening ceremony dance on this place in 1833, led by Yagan. We regard that very significant event as both an exhibition and a declaration, of culture, law and presence. A parallel inspiration for our artwork is those expressive Bush Arches made by colonial europeans for their celebration of Proclamation, (and again for Royal Jubilee welcome events) using native bush vegetation as decoration. Symbolic gateway, threshold, for moving through. Simiarly our awareness of
a previous pavillion on this site lingers as a shadow in the imagination. Body marking applied for Kening provide inspiration for surface texturing of interior facings of the proposed sculpture - engraved/embossed pattern. Our project embodies a unique amalgamation of ancient knowledge, connection to country, songlines and stories, with digital data processing, experimental form-finding, future focussed technologies. All achieved using advanced fabrication methods and contemporary materials. 

Together we strived to create an artwork that can speak of:
• Healing;
• Touching The Earth, Reaching Down, Feeling Energy from Ancestral Spirits;
• Elders Strength, Resilience;
• Future Leaders, Growing & Learning Together;
• Exchanging Skills & Sharing Knowledge Cross-Culturally;
• Recognising and Celebrating Noongar Women in The Matriarchal, Ceremony and Dance Sense.


## Dance (Energy/Celebration/Gathering)

Choosing to to engage with a female dancer and choreographer in the process of finding this sculptural form came from conversation with Uncle Farley Garlett about other histories of the site, beyond those known milestone stories of masculine leaders’ presence at gatherings here (Yellagonga, Midgegooroo, Yagan, the documented 1833 ceremonial kening performance, colonial ceremonies such as 1890 Proclamation of selfgovernment, Jubilee events, military parades, athletics carnivals, Speakers Corner, Invasion Day rallies, National Apology to Stolen Generations, etc). We learned that in language, Derbal Yerrigan is regarded as feminine, a source of nurture, and associated with fertility and new growth. Food gathering, crabbing, fishing and such day to day habitation would once have been familiar along our Booneenoro shoreline and females were also a pivotal part in Noongar Lore ceremony at spots along the river. 

*“As Noongar dancers we dance with no shoes on, so we can connect to country and send a vibration to our old people.” - Karla Hart*

Aunty Fanny Balbok Yondeel was one strong Noongar woman who made her presence felt throughout the city environs, as a traditional owner steadfastly resisting European changes to customs and landscape, expressing her belonging to place and dedicated to her culture and law. Today, many passionately engaged and respected leaders are strong Noongar women - a growing generation of acknowledged spokespeople, future Elders. They represent the powerful spirit and rising energy of contemporary First Nations Cultures, building toward a future of shared respect and unity. One of our ambitions for how the artwork site could continue to reach outward from this process is to commission a contemporary dance work for youth performers, specifically for the place, in response to the sculpture, as part of this artwork project. This is part of how we propose to continue to collaborate with Karla Hart going forward. This newly created cultural asset could then go on to be programmed and performed onsite at future times of significance for Noongar people. It could potentially become part of the larger repository of knowledge shared and passed on. This could also involve composition of accompanying new musical (song) expression.


## Process (The Form of Dance)

The artist team engaged with Karla Hart and Melinda Eades who lead the narratives, stories, songs and choreography relating to the Derbal Yerrigan. Karla's focus was to pay respects and tribute to the strong female elders in her community.
We filmed Melinda dancing along the river, and used computer vision to track her movements and translate dance traditional dance and choreography into a digital space. This was an interative process whereby we could test and explore many outcomes based on what 'nodes' and sequences we pushed through the algorithm. By tracking movements, we generated a series of 'dancing gesture lines' which was basically a wireframe network that we then added volume to it to create the sculpture.

## Collaborators 
**Yondee Shane Hansen** *painter*
Noongar artist, Yondee Shane Hansen was born in Dumbleyung, south of Perth. His bush name, Yondee, means Black Goanna. He spent his early years around Dumbleyung and Narrogin and grew up around the Swan River near Guildford. The story of his early life and attraction to painting strongly informs his identity now as a contemporary Aboriginal artist.An experienced and accomplished artist, Yondee Shane Hansen has developed ways of working with sand and ochres to depict the stories and legends of his people. He also paints detailed figurative works based on mission life, hunting and animals.
His works are abstract in their presentation but narrative in their content. As a child, Yondee learnt his grandfather’s ground paintings and wishes to continue these and feels the translation of them to sand paintings does them justice and brings them to new audiences.

**Karla Hart** *dancer, choreographer, singer*
Karla Hart has an extensive background on radio, as an actress, playwright and producer, as a Noongar cultural dancer and choreographer, singer and speaker, MC, workshop facilitator for dance, Noongar language and performance and as a major event curator. Her film credits include over 70 full length episodes on television. Karla learnt traditional dance from Noongar elders. She also studied Aboriginal Theatre at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts before completing a Bachelor Arts in Contemporary Performance at Edith Cowan University. She has worked at almost every remote community in WA, running dance and performance workshops at schools. She regularly supports and encourages youth, commissioning new Noongar performance pieces and events, and facilitates workshops across the state.
