## Contextural Connection to to Gold Coast and HOTA

*“Home Of The Arts is the home for all things creative. A home that brings people together, where ideas are transformed into real life experiences.”*

Our concept design for the Gateway Welcome experience at the southern landing of the Greenbridge is a vision for a distinctive and engaging space of transition, expressing vitality, creativity and a spirit of connection. Your journey over the Nerang River from Chevron Island to HOTA culminates in an embrace of innovation and contemporary artistic expression, as you approach an elevated outlook over the lake across of the Gold Coast Cultural Precinct. The artwork represents a symbolic and conceptual transition from daily life across the river, into the voronoi filled wonder of the HOTA landscape, through a differentiated delaunay triangulated passage way around the j-curve of the southern landing. The delaunay triangle is derived directly from voronoi pattern geometry.

Framing this threshold is a bold sweeping gestural surface, articulated as a CHS tubular aluminium structural frame, partially infilled with gold anodized aluminium cladding panels. The sculptural form this artwork is inspired by the undulating serpentine qualities of the Gold Coast estuarine environment.


## Project Concept

The HOTA Gold Coast precinct masterplan was designed by ARM Architects and includes an Outdoor Stage, Bridge and Gallery Building. The entire precinct is structured and designed around the 'Voronoi', an organic cellular structure. Given that Grasshopper has a built in component to generate a voronoi, and David Rutten's hidden joke within the software on the over use of the, we decided to find a way to still fit within the theme, but to move away from the Voronoi.

The obvious leap here was to play around with Delayney triangulation as the point set **P** in general position correspondes to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram for **P**. The circumcenters of Delaunay triangles are the vertices of the Voronoi diagram.

The thematic approach to the artwork was to explore the relationships of water and the built environment. The artwork site was the bridge abutment on the Chevron Island side which curves out over the Evandale Lake. We explored the interplay between water and light, and how the caustic reflections have a similar appearance to that of the Voronoi pattern. 

This is the inspiration for having sensors that trigger dynamic lighting influenced by the users of the bridges. Much like the way light and water react, we envisage out artwork to react to the surroundings and context of the southern landing.
