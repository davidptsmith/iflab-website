At if/Lab, digital workflows underpin our daily practice. Our continuing
research in the development of digital workflows enables us to expand
both in iteration within design processes and file to fabrication
opportunities in the construction of architecture. “The inclusive nature
of workflows means they can accommodate the personalised design
processes of architects as well as integrated engineering strategies and
collaborative ideas about building delivery”<sup>1</sup>

We are continually looking to develop our tools which include optimising
information from digital design models to speed up traditional shop
drawing processes and achieve new levels of efficiency and accuracy in
the digital design workflow that support the complexities of
construction.

Construction drawings are an abstract representation that reflects what
is to be built, however, this cannot be the case as there a many
parameters that cannot be controlled onsite. This leads to discrepancies
that if not accounted for can cause major issues when producing
fabrication drawings.

Through a recent engagement on the Forrest Chase Redevelopment project
by Denmac, if/LAB has been able to produce new workflows that facilitate
the production of fabrication documentation from as-constructed site
surveys, reducing the margin of error and creating more accurate
outcomes. This process enabled design changes to occur before
fabrication, allowing increased accuracy of delivered panels, which in
turn reduces onsite complications during installation.

Each panel element produced was unique to accommodate for slight
imperfections of previously installed components on site. Panels were
modified to pick up as constructed locations of columns, and in some
cases, to accommodate the twists in the structural elements picked up in
the point cloud scan.

Traditionally, the panel drawing process involved a designer that would
manually adjust lengths and widths of panels, by ‘pushing or pulling’
the 2D panel in CAD, and then copying and pasting annotation from a
previous panel to the new panels. This opens up a great opportunity for
human error and limits the ability for picking up clashes between
components and panels.

With the vast amount of panels required to be drawn in such a short
timeframe, our automated process enabled increased construction
efficiencies and alleviated bottlenecks that began to show in the
design, fabrication and install process.

The process beings by taking 2d drawings as specified by the engineers
and creates 3D geometry to fit with the as constructed site survey where
intersections with site geometry are resolved and flanges are added to
the model. These panels are then unrolled into drawings where
annotations and dimensions are added after which drawings are exported
and laser cutting files are produced for the fabrication team.

The ability to produce complex 3d modeling enabled for difficult curved
and corner sections to be produced quickly and efficiently where
traditional methods would have faltered.  The ability to automate the
modelling and output of shop-drawings for complex sections from 3D site
scans has proven to be cost and time effective in comparison to
traditional methods; demonstrating the requirement for innovation and
new solutions for design and construction processes.
