Interoperability between design modelling platforms is a significant
challenge for most practitioners operating at the cutting edge of the
AEC industry. No single software is able to cover the increasing breadth
of fields and sectors that designers must traverse in their day-to-day
practice. It is imperative, therefore, that seamless workflows between
software platforms are developed in order to maximise efficiency and
productivity, whilst minimising time wasted with manual conversion or
data clean-up processes. With optimal interoperability workflows, we can
ensure that we use the right tools for the right job at all times.

The design of sheet metal is one that requires the calculation of the
material elasticity that must be considered in the bending process.
Solid modelling software such as Autodesk’s Inventor performs this
calculation through built in sheet metal functions, however design
modelling of nonstandard geometry often occurs in openNURBS-based
modelling software such as McNeel’s Rhino 3D.

The lack of integration between designers and fabricators, skill-sets
and software can often result in inefficiencies throughout the design to
fabrication workflow. The separation of design and shop drawings leads
to a break in workflow processes, which then typically requires
‘double-handling’; a costly and inefficient process. Denmac saw an
opportunity to increase its design to fabrication efficiencies and
engaged if/LAB to assist in creating new workflows and processes to
better meet the changing requirements of the construction industry.

[<u>Denmac</u>](https://www.denmac.net.au/) is an innovative fabrication
company in Perth, WA, with a history spanning over thirty years. They
are a pre-eminent construction contractor that combines innovation,
manufacturing, product delivery and customer engagement. Denmac offers a
wide range of services in complex fabrication and design with a focus on
quality and a brand promise “no matter what it takes, Denmac will
deliver.”

Denmac were exposed to the benefits of computational design workflows
through having worked closely with if/Lab on several public artworks
around Perth. In accordance with their business philosophy and a
realisation of the current shortcomings of the industry, they engaged
if/Lab to assist in finding efficiencies through automation and
digitisation of their internal processes to better meet their client’s
demands.

if/LAB, in collaboration with Denmac, have developed a workflow to
facilitate the production of required fabrication documentation from
design models by automating the link between Rhino 3D and Inventor. The
procedure creates laser cutting files, part models, and shop drawings,
and integrates changes back into BIM environments. This process produces
accurate unfolded sheet metal documentation allowing for the effects of
material elasticity.

Through automation, this workflow reduces the required lead time as
fabrication specific modelling can occur from the design model and be
integrated back into BIM projects at an increased level of detail. By
merging fabrication and design documentation this workflow allows for
feedback and adaptability from the inevitable onsite changes, making the
fabrication process faster, cheaper, and more accurate.
