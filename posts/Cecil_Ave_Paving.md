visualisation*

If/LAB were engaged by [PLACE
Laboratory](https://www.placelaboratory.com/) in a Design Assist role to
develop up and detail paving patterns for their [Cecil Avenue
Masterplan](https://www.placelaboratory.com/project/cecil-avenue-stage-1/).

The masterplan proposal includes a unique and eloquent paving pattern
that spans approximately 380m along Cecil Ave, from Albany Hwy to beyond
Pattie Street. The design intent by PLACE Laboratory was to emulate the
effect of water or tides, similar to the way the ocean’s tides interacts
with the shore.

We were provided with the overall surface pattern masterplan, a paving
sample drawing and pattern details that identified the paving mixes for
each zone.

By using computational design tools such as Grasshopper, we were able to
extrapolate the information provided to visualise the paving pattern
across the entire masterplan. This enabled the designers at PLACE
Laboratory to tweak the patterns, by moving the curves that define each
of the paving ‘zones’. In addition to refining the overall paving
pattern across the site, the custom tool allowed for fine tuning of the
paving distributions, with a live feed of quantities for each paving
type.

**Sketch to Code: Digital Drawing**

An interesting challenge was liaising with the designer, to get inside
their mind and try to understand what they are thinking, in order to
translate their design intuition, into a series of rules that could be
coded.

In our initial briefing meeting with PLACE Laboratory, the designer
instructed us to distribute the selected paving types *randomly.* Upon
meeting again at the next design review, we quickly worked out that the
way they ‘sketched’ out the paving distribution was not entirely random.

*‘Although what you think you are doing is random, there is a good
chance subconsciously you are applying rules and logic to each and every
line you draw.’*

When you ask the machine to do something *random*, it is truly *random*,
when yourself as a designer tries to do something *random*, *random*
your intuition takes over subconsciously, applying some form of logic to
your design.

**Deliverables: Output**

As part of our deliverables, we were asked to deliver detail layout
plans and quantities for Lighting Brick, who are contracted to install
the pavers. The grasshopper code allowed for the nominated gap between
pavers, with each and every single paver constructed – proving us with
an accurate and automated material takeoffs, which would otherwise have
been guesswork.

 A suite of drawing and layout tools developed in-house was used to
automate the production of the drawings, which consisted of 32 detail
plans at 1:50 on A1 Sheets. These drawings will then be used by
Lightning Bricks for install.

**Visualisation**

In addition to assisting PLACE Laboratory in design, and providing the
shop drawings for install, the detailed 3D model was used to produce
accurate visualisations of the final pattern distribution to share with
the clients and stakeholders.
