Charlie Boman is graduate architect at Roland Snooks Studios and a research assistant and sessional tutor at RMIT.

Studio Roland Snooks explores the complexity of the contemporary social and natural world through the creation of objects, installations, public art and architectural projects. This work draws on an understanding of the underlying processes of formation that give rise to these contemporary conditions. The studio redeploys these processes through algorithmic techniques in the creation of highly detailed and intricate forms. 

At RMIT, Charlie is involved in a body of research that explores advanced manufacturing processes. such as innovative ways of 3D printing. Charlie is currently researching cmt welding as a means of metal printing.
