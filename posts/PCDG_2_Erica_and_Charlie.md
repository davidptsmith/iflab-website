# **Charlie Boman - Roland Snooks Studio** 

Charlie Boman is graduate architect at [Roland Snooks
Studios](http://www.rolandsnooks.com/) and a research assistant and
sessional tutor at RMIT.

Studio Roland Snooks explores the complexity of the contemporary social
and natural world through the creation of objects, installations, public
art and architectural projects. This work draws on an understanding of
the underlying processes of formation that give rise to these
contemporary conditions. The studio redeploys these processes through
algorithmic techniques in the creation of highly detailed and intricate
forms.

At RMIT, Charlie is involved in a body of research that explores
advanced manufacturing processes. such as innovative ways of 3D
printing. Charlie is currently researching cmt welding as a means of
metal printing.
