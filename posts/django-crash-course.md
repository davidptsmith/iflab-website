Meet the speaker..
CAPITAL HOUSE AUSTRALASIA (CHA) - Brian A Nelson 

Brian Nelson is a founding director of CHA (Consulting Civil & Structural Engineers).


Over the past decade, he has researched and applied the use of FRP composites to a range of over 30 varied structural applications, from fine art pieces to bridges. Primary drivers have been the objectives of achieving large scale, high-quality surfaced structures. These have been achieved through radically differing manufacturing approaches. Significantly, many solutions have arisen out of the conversion of projects, originally conceived of orthodox materials, to FRP. 

Technical, commercial and industrial interfacing between designer-engineer-constructor-client have required development of approaches unique to the medium.   

More recently, to further benefit from the many inherent attributesâ€™ and efficiencies that composites offer, projects have centered on taking a mass production approach to manufacturing.
