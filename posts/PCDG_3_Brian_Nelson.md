**[<u>CAPITAL HOUSE
AUSTRALASIA</u>](http://www.capitalhouse.com.au/composites/) (CHA) -
Brian A Nelson**

Brian Nelson is a founding director of CHA (Consulting Civil &
Structural Engineers).

Over the past decade, he has researched and applied the use of FRP
composites to a range of over 30 varied structural applications, from
fine art pieces to bridges. Primary drivers have been the objectives of
achieving large scale, high-quality surfaced structures. These have been
achieved through radically differing manufacturing approaches.
Significantly, many solutions have arisen out of the conversion of
projects, originally conceived of orthodox materials, to FRP. 

Technical, commercial and industrial interfacing between
designer-engineer-constructor-client have required development of
approaches unique to the medium.   

More recently, to further benefit from the many inherent attributes’ and
efficiencies that composites offer, projects have centered on taking a
mass production approach to manufacturing.
