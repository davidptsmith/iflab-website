Documenting for fabrication requires modeling at an increased level
accuracy than possible from design models, however, sometimes it is not
feasible to get a site survey scan. Working with
[Denmac](https://www.denmac.net.au/), if/Lab has developed a
[workflow](https://iflab.squarespace.com/blog-home?tag=Workflow) that
seamlessly transfers simple site measurements into the production of
fabrication drawings for sheet metal panels; increasing accuracy whilst
eliminating the need for repetitive manual documentation processes.

The process begins with workers on site measuring panel regions and
location of intersecting geometry; providing if/lab with a sketch of the
panel sizing or distances and set out points. From here these hand-drawn
measurements are entered into inputs of the grasshopper script producing
3-dimensional geometry and fabrication documentation.

After the geometry is produced by the script, the onsite measurements
are checked against the structural model to foresee any major issues or
errors that may have been missed onsite. The review process allows
feedback from design, fabrication and installation personnel to comment
and changes to be made before the panels arrive onsite saving time and
money.

After the changes have been made and the 3D model is deemed correct by
review process the shop drawings and laser cutting files are updated
directly from the model and issued for fabrication without the need for
manual changes. After the panels arrive on site the installation team
can review and check how the elements are to be installed by referencing
the 3D model and reference imagery, reducing the ambiguity of
traditional 2-dimensional drawings, increasing the efficiency of the
installation process.

By allowing for the input of low-tech and cheap site measure processes
combined with seamless modelling, review and documentation processes,
If/lab has been able to assist in closing the gap between the design,
fabrication and installation team to create a fast, cheap and accurate
solution to a complex construction problem without the need for costly
technology.
